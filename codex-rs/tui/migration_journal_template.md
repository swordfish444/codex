# Migration journal – {{MIGRATION_SUMMARY}}

> Workspace: `{{WORKSPACE_NAME}}`
> Created: {{CREATED_AT}}

Use this log for async updates, agent hand-offs, and to publish what was learned during each workstream. Keep entries concise and focused on signals other collaborators need.

## Logging guidance
- Start each entry with a timestamp and author/agent/workstream name.
- Capture what changed, how it was validated, links to diffs/tests, and any open questions.
- Highlight blockers, decisions needed, or knowledge that other agents should adopt.
- Update the plan (`plan.md`) when scope changes; use this journal for progress + lessons.
